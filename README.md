# The Wordle Buddy App

Have you ever been playing a game of Wordle and can't think of another word to use? Well think no more, because now you have the WordleBuddy app! WordleBuddy can, given a set of words used so far, show you a list of words that the Wordle words could be. Let's show an example:

Pretending the Wordle word is *scrap*, supposed we have the following guesses:

If we clicked the `Generate` button, we would get this:

And you can see *scrap* is on the list!

WordleBuddy also has the ability to check if a word has been used before, since Wordle as of now does not repeat words. You can filter the list of generated words by this, or search in the `Check If Used` tab to search for a specific word's previous Wordle usage. Happy Wordling!
